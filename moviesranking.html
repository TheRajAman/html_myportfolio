<h1>Top Three Movies: Aman's Favourite</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Dead Poet Society</h2>
<p>
    Robin Williams is one piece of great artist. I watched his 'Good Will Hunting, and when i saw <br />
    his guest appearance in 'Friends' TV show, that's when i decided I'm gonna explore him.<br />
    Film was certainly based on the pressure/fuss people makes about getting higher grades in school, <br />
    rather than learning the way of life. Mr. Keating is the teacher I never had. I always lack the <br />
    mentorship in my life. This type of film is really making me to explore the 90s american-english cinema. <br />
    Well, this film doesn't end on a very good note, Ending was sad but rather satisfying. <br />
    I may be to conscious about it, But Hindi Films like '3-Idiots' and 'Mohabbatein' were <br />
    seemed to be inspired from this.
<br />
    What does this film teach me? [ This section can have different saying for you]<br />
    This film showed that doesn't matter how imperfect you're in things, keep doing this<br />
    as long as this entertain you. Don't try to be perfect. Imperfection is the journey you're <br />
    going to enjoy till you became perfect.

<h2>Insomnia</h2>
<p>
   Just watched it. Not a very NOLAN film[no mind bending things and no time was harmed in making this film]. <br />
   However, this is such type of film you wish Nolan can make more.<br />
<br />
    This is the crime-thriller. This film is gonna keep on edge for half of the duration. <br />
    I was exploring Robin Williams' works[as i have written in other videos], then I came to know about this film. <br />
    Robin Williams in a film directed by Nolan and Al Pacino as the main lead is just icing on the cake. <br />
    Not a very long film but still you won't realize when do this 118 minutes passed!<br />
<h2>Enemy</h2>
<p>
  Jake Gyllenhaal is damn good actor, man. Well, it was not the acting, that made me stay on the edge, it was the story.<br />
  Suppose, You're living a peaceful life, and suddenly you find yourself in a movie. However you never auditioned for any movies. <br />
<br />
  This film seems to be character meet-up arc type stuffs, yet there's ton of loneliness in each scene.
  The film felt certainly depressed, the saturated cinematography was prolific. Every second in the film were 
  like if there's going to be great tsunami or earthquake that's gonna eat up the world.<br />
  [Well that is what felt]<br />
<br />
  SO, what do we learn from the movie?
  Even a man with identical features as you can't be you. You are you because of you lived your life by yourself.
  You are you because the person around you made you up their thoughts. You are you because you worked hard to be you.
  Yes, an another person can do similar hard work to be you, still they won't get succeeded,
  because they won't be putting their hard work in direction as you did.<br />
